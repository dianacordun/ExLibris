🔝 Here you will find ExLibris, a web application created to guide
users through efficiently monitoring their ongoing reading activities.

📖 In today’s world everything is fast-paced and tracking personal habits can become
intimidating. Considering the ascending number of books being published and even
the number of different editions of the same book, difficulties for readers in tracking their
progress do not cease to appear.

📚 ExLibris presents a creative yet easy-to-understand solution to the problems readers
face in observing their reading patterns. The application allows users to start reading
sessions, add what books they want to their library, and promotes an organized approach
to reading, be it for academic or entertainment purposes.
More than that, ExLibris offers a feeling of accomplishment to its users, allowing
them to observe their progress with each book they read. The element
that makes the application original is especially the personalized statistics for each book of
every user. The users can follow a graphic representation of the evolution of the average
time spent on a page. Using these data, the time remaining until the end of each
book will be estimated for them.
